Murder mystery   Who the hell broke the ping pong ball?   Two witnesses  witness 1: 
I was in school til pretty late and when I left there were still 3 people in the room. 
They were all from Digital Design so I don’t know the name of them. 
But one of them had beef jerky. It smelled like old meat. 
I found a part of a receipt where you could see that it was bought from a shop with the letter “lan” in it.
