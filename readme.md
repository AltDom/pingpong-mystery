Murder Mystery

Who the hell broke the ping pong ball? 

Two witnesses
Witness 1: 
I stayed back late at school yesterday and when I left there were still three athletes playing in the room. 
I don’t remember who there were. One of them had beef jerky which filled the room with an old musky smell, and that's actually why I left. He/She dropped their receipt which had been ripped. I made out that it'd been bought from a shop with the letters “lan” in the name. 

Witness 2:
"There's a whole box of ping pong balls next door. Can you please leave me alone as I'm having enough trouble with JavaScript without you carrying on."


(Search lan and find Gulan) -> go to interviews and look up Gulan interview.

Gulan owner:
Yeah ..of course I remember! How could I forget? He demanded beef jerkyand a Vanilla Coke, and then spewed on the floor before he left. He didn't even clean up after himself! He got away on a VOI scooter, and the license plate number included the numbers “8642”. Take a free Mars Bar for your troubles.

  - > look up the list of VOI Scooters with this number and if they were used this date.   Innerjoin users of VOI scooters with people going in Digital Design to find the one who broke it.
