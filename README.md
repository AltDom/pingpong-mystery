## About This Project
Can you solve the Ping Pong Mysteries!? You will need to be cunning and use SQLite database queries to uncover who it was who committed the ultimate sports crime. Your journey will be challenging. Your journey will be treacherous. Do you dare to follow a trail into the unknown where pure evil undoubtedly awaits!? 

## Before You Begin
To set the scene of this crime assume you are a young police cadet on the Gothenburg Police Force. Determined to impress the chief commissioner you're on the hunt to crack your first big case before the season is out. On an icy winter's morning you receive a chilling phonecall from the principal of Yrgo, Lindholmen. Though you're not ususally one to trust New Zealanders, you're drawn to the peculiarity of this case as well as the sense of urgency in her voice. 

When you arrive at Yrgo the principal invites you into her office for tea and cookies.   
"Do you take milk with your tea?"   
"Why yes, thank you, that would be lovely".  
Vanilla rooibos ..it's delicious.

Over the course of a solid 30-minutes of having your ears hammered about seemingly everything but the crime (Thank God for the cookies!), you're told that an inportant piece of Yrgo **property** has been **damaged**. Unfortunately the criminal, still at large, has managed to flea the scene unnoticed. You're given the current list of **Yrgo incidents** as a starting point, and apparently in there somewhere a student has logged their account of what happened. You're immediately suspicious as to why the principal hasn't already gone to the effort of finding out what was damaged. Further, why didn't she mark this first logged entry for you? Something doesn't feel right ..the distressed phone call, the tea and snacks, and now she doesn't even know what happened.  

It's too soon to start pointing fingers and your only option is to follow the lead that you've been given. 
Good luck, be careful and watch your back. It's quickly becoming clear that there's danger around every corner of these corridors!
