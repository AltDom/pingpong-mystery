## About This Project
Can you solve the Ping Pong Mysteries!? You will need to be cunning and use database queries to uncover who it was who committed the ultimate sports crime. Your journey will be challenging. Your journey will be treacherous. Do you dare to follow a trail into the unknown where pure evil undoubtedly awaits!? 

## Before You Begin
To set the scene of this crime assume you are a young police cadet on the Gothenburg Police Force with only 1 year's training. Determined to impress the chief commissioner you're on the hunt to crack your first big case before the season is out. On an icy winter's morning you receive a chilling phonecall from the principal of Yrgo, Lindholmen. Though you're not ususally one to trust New Zealanders, you're drawn to the peculiarity of this case as well as the sense of urgency in her voice. 

When you arrive at Yrgo the principal invites you into her office for tea and cookies.   
"Do you take milk with your tea?"   
"Why yes, thank you, that would be lovely".

Over the course of a solid 30-minutes of having your ears hammered about seemingly everything but the crime (Thank God for the cookies!), you're told that an inportant piece of Yrgo **property** has been **damaged**. Unfortunately the hunted criminal, still at large, managed to flea the scene unnoticed, however you're given the current list of **Yrgo incidents** as a starting point, and apparently a student has logged somewhere in there what happened. You're immediately suspicious as to why the principal didn't go to the effort of finding this logged entry for you, but it's too soon to point fingers. You must follow the lead that you've been given. 

Good luck, be careful and watch your back. There's danger around every corner of these corridors!
